This result highlights the significant difference of omega (dN/dS: non-synonymous substitution rate/synonymous substitution rate) between repeat-containing genes and genes without repeats across various clades of Tetrapoda.
Please note:
We have zipped the file "omega_species_without_repeats_final" because of its large size. Please run the following command on your terminal before proceeding further:
unzip omega_species_without_repeats_final.zip


To generate the figure, run the following command on your Linux terminal by being in the same directory as input files:
1. To generate the omega figure (Supplementary figure) with all the omega combined:
Rscript omega_boxplot_all.r
2. To generate the omega figure (Main figure) with only omega values less than 2:
Rscript omega_boxplot_lessthantwo.r

Note: The above scripts are R language scripts to it require that you have R installed in your Linux system with the desired packages and it is callable.
